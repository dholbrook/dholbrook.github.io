The conversion from Blogger to [Octopress](http://octopress.org/)/[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) went a lot smoother than I expected it to.  The DNS now seems to be working correctly, I've updated Google Analytics to use the new site, and I added some redirect pages that match the old site so searches can still find the old content.

I still have a few things I want to do.

- Change the default Octopress favicon.
- Add a top categories sidebar
- Categorize old articles

As an aside, I'm really enjoying using Markdown to author blog posts.  I'm using [MakrdownPad 2](http://markdownpad.com/) on Windows and it is very slick.
